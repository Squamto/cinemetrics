cinemetrics is about measuring and visualizing movie data, in order to reveal the characteristics of films and to create a visual "fingerprint" for them. Information such as the editing structure, color, speech or motion are extracted, analyzed and transformed into graphic representations so that movies can be seen as a whole and easily interpreted or compared side by side.

at the moment these tools lack proper documentation, sorry.
